# Poké Balls/Coit Tower Problem

Step 1: Define key information
* Poké Balls completely fill the Coit Tower
* Coit Tower is cylindrical(ish)
* Poké Balls are spherical
* Poké Balls can shrink to a smaller size or grow to a larger size
* We want to find: how many Poké Balls will fit in the Coit Tower

Step 2: Think very hard about plan
  1. Estimate, calculate, or find the volume of the Coit Tower
  2. Estimate, calculate, or find the volume a Poké Ball
  3. Divide the volume of the Coit Tower by the volume of a Poké Ball
  4. Multiply the number of Poké Balls found above by the packing density
  
Step 3: Step 2.1: Find Volume of Coit Tower\
[source](https://prezi.com/dkixudzcjmvj/coit-tower-design/): height = 210 ft, diameter = 32 ft\
V = 3.14 * (16ft)<sup>2</sup> * 210ft = 168,806.4ft<sup>3</sup>

Step 4: Step 2.2: Find Volume of Poké Ball\
A fair number of people on the internet seem to believe that a full-sized Poké Ball is about the size of a tennis ball and that a shrunken Poké Ball is about the size of a ping pong ball\
source: people on the internet\
Suppose the diameter of a full-sized Poké Ball is 2.7in and the diameter of a shrunken Poké Ball is 4cm\
V<sub>full</sub> = (4/3) * 3.14 * (1.35in)<sup>3</sup> = 10.3in<sup>3</sup>\
V<sub>shrunken</sub> = (4/3) * 3.14 * (2cm)<sup>3</sup> = 33.49cm<sup>3</sup>

Step 5: Step 2.3: Divide the volume of the Coit Tower by the volume of a Poké Ball\
168,806.4ft<sup>3</sup> * (12in/1ft)<sup>3</sup> / 10.3in<sup>3</sup> = 28,320,141.67 Poké Balls\
168,806.4ft<sup>3</sup> * (30.48cm/1ft)<sup>3</sup> / 33.49cm<sup>3</sup> = 142,731,111.75 Poké Balls

Step 6: Step 2.4: Multiply the numbers above by the random packing density\
Assume the spheres were randomly packed. The packing density for items randomly jammed into a container is 64%. [source](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomClosePacking.html)\
28,320,141.67 * .64 = 18,124,890.67\
Round down since we can't have part of a Poké Ball\
142,731,111.75 * .64 = 91,347,911.52\
The Coit Tower can hold 18,124,890 full-sized Poké Balls or 91,347,911 shrunken Poké Balls.
